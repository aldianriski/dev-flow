## init Phase *(canonical scaffold contract — ADR-028)*

Full output of `/orchestrator init` = canonical scaffold contract per ADR-028 DEC-1. Both invocation paths (plugin install via `/orchestrator init`; scaffold copy via `node bin/dev-flow-init.js`) converge on the same outputs.

**Scaffold output (11 files + 2 empty dirs):**

| Path | Source | Purpose |
|:-----|:-------|:--------|
| `.claude/CLAUDE.md` | `templates/CLAUDE.md.template` (rendered) | Project AI context |
| `.claude/CONTEXT.md` | copied from dev-flow `.claude/CONTEXT.md` | Vocab · gates · modes · agent roster |
| `.claude/settings.json` | copied from dev-flow `.claude/settings.json` | CC harness config + hook registration |
| `.claude/settings.local.json` | rendered from `.claude/settings.local.example.json` | Per-machine settings + lint/typecheck commands per stack preset |
| `TODO.md` | `templates/TODO.md.template` (rendered) | Sprint tracker |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | `templates/ARCHITECTURE.md.template` | Component map · key patterns |
| `docs/CHANGELOG.md` | `templates/CHANGELOG.md.template` | Release history (Keep-a-Changelog format) |
| `docs/DECISIONS.md` | `templates/DECISIONS.md.template` | ADR registry index |
| `docs/AI_CONTEXT.md` | `templates/AI_CONTEXT.md.template` | Patterns · conventions · current focus |
| `docs/SETUP.md` | `templates/SETUP.md.template` | Local dev setup guide |
| `docs/codemap/.gitkeep` | empty file | Codemap-refresh hook target dir (populated on first commit) |
| `docs/adr/.gitkeep` | empty file | adr-writer skill target dir (populated when first ADR lands) |
| `README.md` | `templates/README.md.template` (rendered) | Project README |
| `.gitignore` | `templates/gitignore.template` | dev-flow harness + node common entries |

**Stack preset selection** (script prompt at `bin/dev-flow-init.js` runtime):

| Preset | Layers | lint | typecheck | pkg manager |
|:-------|:-------|:-----|:----------|:------------|
| `node-express` | api, service, repository, middleware, model | `npm run lint` | `npx tsc --noEmit` | `npm` |
| `react-next` | api, hook, component, page, store, infrastructure | `npm run lint` | `npx tsc --noEmit` | `npm` |
| `python-fastapi` | api, service, repository, middleware, model | `ruff check .` | `mypy .` | `pip` |
| `go-gin` | api, service, repository, middleware, model | `go vet ./...` | `go build ./...` | `go` |
| `custom` | user-supplied | user-supplied | user-supplied | user-supplied |

`lint` + `typecheck` are wired into `.claude/settings.local.json` PreToolUse hooks for `Bash(git commit*)` — fire before any commit lands.

**Convergence (plugin install vs scaffold copy):** plugin install path delivers hooks via `hooks/hooks.json` auto-discovery (no settings.json required). Scaffold copy path delivers same hooks via `.claude/settings.json` (since user has no plugin install). bin/dev-flow-init.js copies dev-flow's `.claude/settings.json` verbatim, ensuring identical hook registration content for both paths. `settings.local.json` (per-machine) is rendered from `settings.local.example.json` with stack-specific lint/typecheck substituted.

**Idempotency:** `createEmptyScaffoldDirs` is safe to re-run — preserves existing `.gitkeep` files; does not clobber user content. `renderSettingsLocal` writes `.new` suffix if existing `settings.local.json` present (per-machine config not overwritten). Other templates DO overwrite — `init` is intended for first-time scaffold; re-running on a populated repo requires user to confirm overwrite at first prompt.

## Session Close *(after commit)*

Task state written to `TODO.md` only — CC TaskCreate/TaskList not used (ADR-012).

```
## Session Close — [task] — [date]
docs touched: <file> | <change>
TODO.md: task marked [x] | changelog row added
next: <next open task or "sprint complete — run /lean-doc-generator Sprint Close">
```

Sprint complete path: all tasks `[x]` → run `/lean-doc-generator` Sprint Close, then `/lean-doc-generator` Sprint Promote next session.

## sprint-bulk Phase (mvp-class, batched)

Use when running a multi-task sprint end-to-end. Replaces per-task G1+G2 with a single batched gate pass + auto-loop.

**Advisory skill hints** (fire per detection at session-start / pre-G1 / G1 / Implement / Review / close):
- `prime` — runs at session start before any orchestrator dispatch (NOT orchestrator-triggered; user-invoked or session-start hook)
- `zoom-out` — propose before G1 if any task touches an unfamiliar module OR is cross-cutting
- `diagnose` — propose at Implement phase if G1 task-type = bug-fix / failing test
- `tdd` — propose at Implement phase if G1 task-type = feature / new behavior requiring tests
- `refactor-advisor` — propose post-Review if code-reviewer flags complexity smells
- `release-manager` — propose at sprint close if MINOR or MAJOR bump required; else `release-patch` (PATCH auto-detect path)

**1. Sprint Scope Batch (G1 once)**
- Read all `[ ]` tasks under `## Active Sprint` in TODO.md.
- Run G1 checklist for the sprint as a whole: combined goal, total size (must be ≤ M when summed; L → split sprint), shared constraints, sprint-wide red flags.
- BLOCK if any sprint-level red flag fails.

**2. Sprint Design Batch (G2 once)**
- Auto-dispatch `scope-analyst` ONCE with the full task list. Expect FILES AFFECTED list per task.
- Auto-dispatch `design-analyst` ONCE with combined task list — produces a session-scoped sprint-PRD block (not written to disk; persistent artifact = separate task).
- BLOCK on any `BLOCKED` finding. Hard-to-reverse decision → dispatch `adr-writer`.

**3. Overlap derivation (parallelism gate)**
- For each task pair `(Ti, Tj)`, compute `FILES_AFFECTED(Ti) ∩ FILES_AFFECTED(Tj)`.
- If ANY pair has non-empty intersection → run sequentially (default).
- If ALL pairs have empty intersection → fan out tasks to parallel subagents.
- Pure set intersection on path strings; no schema change to scope-analyst needed.

**4. Sequential auto-loop (default path)**
- Iterate Active Sprint tasks `[ ]` in declared order.
- Per-task: run Implement → propose `code-reviewer` y/n (per dispatcher dispatch rules; never auto-fire) → Commit → mark `[x]`.
- After each task close, advance to next `[ ]`.

**5. First-blocker halt**
- Halt loop on first of: scope-analyst returns `BLOCKED`, design-analyst returns `BLOCKED`, human types `block` at any task boundary, code-reviewer returns `CRITICAL`.
- Do NOT auto-skip blocked task. Report which task halted, why, and the remaining task list. Wait for human direction.

**6. Sprint close**
- When all tasks are `[x]`: run `/lean-doc-generator` Sprint Close, then prompt for `/release-patch` if version bump applicable.

**Note**: sprint-PRD is session-scoped — emitted as a formatted block in the conversation, never written to disk. Persistent artifact creation is out of scope; separate task if needed.

## Mid-Sprint Friction Protocol

**Trigger** (TASK-123 F5(C)): AI surfaces an issue mid-task OR human types `friction` at any task boundary during Sprint Execute.

**Prompt to human:**
```
[friction] <one-line issue description>
Fix now / defer / block?
  fix              — halt current task step; address inline; resume from suspended step
  defer <reason>   — write TD row in TODO.md § Tech Debt + continue task
  block            — halt sprint per First-Blocker Halt rule (sprint-bulk Phase Step 5)
```

**On `fix`:** suspend current task step; complete fix; run feedback loop (test/lint/typecheck); resume from suspended step.

**On `defer <one-line-reason>`:** write `TD-NNN` row in `TODO.md § Tech Debt` immediately:
- `severity:` human-supplied OR AI-assessed (`trivial | minor | medium | high`)
- `source:` `session <ISO-date> mid-sprint T<N>` (current sprint task ID)
- `status: open`
- `sprint-created: <NNN>` (current sprint number)
- Summary line: the deferred-reason verbatim

Then continue current task. Do NOT halt for defer.

**On `block`:** invoke First-Blocker Halt (sprint-bulk Phase Step 5). Halts loop; reports halted task + remaining list; waits for human direction.

**Anti-pattern locks** for TD rows written via this protocol → see `lean-doc-generator/references/SPRINT_PROTOCOLS.md § Tech Debt Anti-Pattern Locks`.
